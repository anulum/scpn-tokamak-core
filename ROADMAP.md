SCPN Tokamak Core — ROADMAP
-->

# Roadmap

Planned work and implemented capability are kept strictly separate. Anything
listed under "Planned" carries no implementation, no code, and no claim in
this repository until it appears in the capability inventory with evidence.

## Implemented (repository infrastructure, not reactor capability)

- Domain manifest (`reactor-domain.json`) with validator.
- Derived Studio portfolio descriptor (`not_federated`) with drift check.
- Generated capability inventory (truthfully empty) with drift check.
- CONTROL adapter specification (contract only, no implementation).
- Local and workflow gate definitions (lint, typing, tests, coverage,
  REUSE, security audit, SBOM, documentation checks).

## Planned (no implementation exists; ordering is not a commitment)

1. **Device configuration model** — typed configuration policy for
   `conventional_tokamak` and `spherical_tokamak` (geometry envelopes,
   coil-system boundaries, fuelling and heating inventory), with
   evidence-maturity target `computational_prototype`.
2. **Diagnostic and clock semantics** — declared diagnostic channels,
   reference frames, and clock identities aligned with the SCPN Phase
   Orchestrator semantic profile.
3. **Safety-envelope declaration** — machine-readable operational envelope
   consumed by the CONTROL adapter contract.
4. **CONTROL adapter implementation** — device-owned adapter against the
   published specification, with replay fixtures and HIL evidence, targeting
   `control_research_ready` only after replay and HIL acceptance.
5. **Solver seam consumption** — versioned consumption of exact
   `SCPN-FUSION-CORE` seams for tokamak equilibrium and transport surfaces,
   strictly after the family migration gate proves exact replacement; no
   solver code is copied.
6. **Facility-data correlation** — preregistered acceptance contracts against
   identified facility or published experimental data, targeting
   `experiment_correlated` per capability.

## Not planned in this repository

Stellarator-family systems, reversed-field pinches, spheromaks, FRC physics,
pinches, inertial and magneto-inertial systems, mirrors, electrostatic
devices, generic controller mathematics, machine-protection logic, and any
direct actuation path.
